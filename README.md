# Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) Parking Management System


## Overview

This project implements an Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) Parking Management System using Python, Firebase Realtime Database, and Flask for the web interface. The system allows for automatic detection and capture of license plates from images, vehicle entry and exit simulation, and real-time visualization of parking slot occupancy.

## Features

* Automatic detection and capture of license plates from images using OpenCV.
* Simulation of vehicle entry and exit.
* Real-time visualization of parking slot occupancy.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Firebase Realtime Database
* Flask
* OpenCV
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
https://github.com/ayanabedin1105/ANPR-UI-Code.git
```
2. Install the required Python Packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Set up Firebase Realtime Database and replace the credentials in the code with your own.
4. Run the Flask web server:
```bash
python app.py
```
5. Access the web interface in your browser at http://localhost:5000.

## Usage

1. Upload images containing license plates to the system.
2. Simulate vehicle entry and exit through the web interface.
3. View real-time updates of parking slot occupancy.
